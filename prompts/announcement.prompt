Write a short, exciting announcement post for the following product feature.
This should work for both internal communications and social media.

Feature title: {title}  
Key benefits: {benefits}  
Release version (if applicable): {version_line}

Your goal:
- Use an enthusiastic tone that energizes both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Include 2–3 bullet points showing what the feature enables.
- End with a strong sentence about availability or next steps.
- Keep it under 100 words.
- Include hashtags like #FeatureLaunch and one or two related to the feature.

Determine the announcement type:
- Is it a brand-new capability we’ve launched?
- Is it support for an external tool or standard (e.g. OpenTofu)?
- Is it a best practice or implementation pattern we're improving?

Use the tone type below to guide your phrasing:
Tone type: {tone_type}

Tone mapping:
- **integration** → Start with: "Unleash now supports {title}..."
- **feature_flag** or **new_capability** → Start with: "Now available: {title}..."
- **best_practice** → Frame it as: "It’s now easier than ever to adopt {title} with Unleash..."
