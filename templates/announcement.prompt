Write a short, exciting announcement post for the following product feature.  
This should work for both internal communications and social media.

Feature title: {title}  
Key benefits: {benefits}  
Release version (if applicable): {version_line}

Your goal:
- Use a warm, enthusiastic tone that energizes both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Open strong, using the tone type guidance below to frame the feature.
- Include a short paragraph (2–3 sentences) explaining the value and purpose of the feature.
- Follow with 2–3 bullet points showing what it enables or improves.
- End with a bold call to action, inviting readers to try it, explore docs, or read the blog.
- Keep it under 150–200 words.
- Include hashtags like #FeatureLaunch and one or two relevant to the feature.

Determine the announcement type:
- Is it a brand-new capability {COMPANY_NAME} has launched?
- Is it support for an external tool or standard (e.g. OpenTofu)?
- Is it a best practice or implementation pattern {COMPANY_NAME} is making easier?

Use the tone type below to guide the opening sentence:

Tone type: {tone_type}

Tone mapping:
- **integration** → Start with: "{COMPANY_NAME} now supports {title}..."
- **feature_flag** or **new_capability** → Start with: "Now available: {title} from {COMPANY_NAME}..."
- **best_practice** → Frame it as: "It’s now easier than ever to adopt {title} with {COMPANY_NAME}..."
