Blog Title: {title}

Write a technical blog post aimed at software engineers and DevOps practitioners.  
The topic of the blog is: "{title}" — this is the core theme, and should be central throughout the piece.

Use the heading structure of the {seo_outline} as a guide to shape your sections, but focus primarily on writing about "{title}".
You should analyse the {seo_outline} and add short sections about the points that relate to the {title} most. Only add sections that are relevant to the {title}.

Substitute H2 and H3 tags with ## and ### accordingly.

Structure your blog using the following outline:

1. **Introduction** – Introduce the concept of "{title}" and why it matters.
2. **What is {title}?** – Define and explain the concept clearly.
3. **Key Benefits** – Use these points to inform this section: {benefits}
4. **Real-world Use Case** – Describe this example scenario: {use_case}
5. Use the following SEO-derived headings as inspiration for section ideas or language. Do **not** add section and explicitly mention company other than {company_name}:
{seo_outline}
6. MANDATORY SECTION: ## Where to find {title} support – Explain how {company_name} offers value in this context. Start with a line such as "At {company_name}, we understand the importance of {title} in {use_case}".
7. MANDATORY SECTION: ### Call to Action – Direct readers to:
   - Trial: {trial_link}
   - Docs: {docs_link}
   - Community: {community_link}

Maintain a professional, insightful tone. The goal is to educate first, and sell later.
