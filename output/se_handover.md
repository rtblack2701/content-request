# SE Trunk-based development Handover

## Feature Description
Trunk-based development (TBD) is a crucial practice in modern DevOps that enhances collaboration, reduces integration complexity, and accelerates delivery cycles. It emphasizes the use of a single integration branch (the trunk) where all developers commit their changes, fostering a more streamlined and efficient development process.

## Real-world Use Case
A mid-sized SaaS company building a customer-facing analytics dashboard uses trunk-based development in combination with feature management to accelerate delivery while minimizing risk. Developers commit directly to main, wrapping in-progress features in Unleash flags to ensure safe deployments. For example, while working on a new “Real-Time Insights” panel, backend and frontend changes were integrated incrementally over several weeks, with the UI gated behind a realtime_insights_enabled flag. This allowed internal QA and selected beta users to test the feature early without impacting the broader user base. As feedback came in, the team iterated quickly, toggling the feature on for more users before eventually removing the flag and making the feature available to everyone. This approach enabled continuous integration, faster feedback loops, and safer experimentation—all without the complexity of long-lived branches.

## Real-life Scenario Comparison
Imagine you're working on a group project to build a model car. Each person in the group is responsible for a different part of the model: the body, the wheels, the engine, and the paint job.

In a traditional model, each person would work on their part separately, and when everyone is done, you'd try to put all the pieces together. This might lead to problems - the wheels might not fit the body, the engine might be too big, the paint job might not cover all the parts. You'd then have to spend extra time fixing these issues and making sure everything fits together perfectly.

Trunk-based development is like having everyone work on their parts but periodically integrating them into the model car. The person working on the body would add the frame to the model, then the person working on the wheels would add them to the frame, and so on. This way, if something doesn't fit or work correctly, you'd notice the problem immediately, not at the very end. You'd fix the issues as they come up, and by the time everyone has finished their parts, the model car is already complete and working perfectly. You've saved time and avoided the headache of last-minute fixes.
