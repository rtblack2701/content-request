Heading: SE Trunk-based Development Handover

Feature Description:
Trunk-based development (TBD) is a key practice in modern DevOps that enhances collaboration, reduces integration complexity, and accelerates delivery cycles. It encourages the use of a single integration branch (the trunk) where all developers commit their changes, fostering a more streamlined and efficient development process.

Real-world Use Case:
A mid-sized SaaS company creating a customer-facing analytics dashboard uses TBD combined with feature management to speed up delivery while minimizing risk. Developers commit directly to the main trunk, wrapping in-progress features in Unleash flags to ensure safe deployments. For instance, while working on a new “Real-Time Insights” panel, backend and frontend changes were integrated incrementally over several weeks. The UI was gated behind a realtime_insights_enabled flag, allowing internal QA and chosen beta users to test the feature early without affecting the broader user base. As feedback was received, the team iterated quickly and toggled the feature on for more users before eventually removing the flag and making the feature available for all. This approach enabled continuous integration, faster feedback loops, and safer experimentation—without the complexity of long-lived branches.

Real-life Scenario Comparison:
Trunk-based development can be compared to a highway with multiple lanes. All developers are driving on the same highway (the trunk) but in different lanes (their local copies). They merge their changes into the main lane regularly, ensuring smooth traffic flow and avoiding traffic jams that result from merging all at once.

Key Benefits:
TBD can accelerate delivery, improve code quality, and enhance collaboration among developers.

How to Enable the Feature:
Trunk-based development is currently behind the Turn on TBD_FF feature flag. To enable it, add a request in the #slack-channel to activate it on your account.
