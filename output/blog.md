# Trunk-based Development: A Key Practice Among DevOps Teams

As a developer or DevOps practitioner, you're likely to be familiar with various version control management practices. One such practice that has been gaining significant traction is trunk-based development. In this article, we'll delve into what trunk-based development is, its benefits, and how to implement it. 

## What is Trunk-based Development?

Trunk-based development (TBD) is a software development approach where all developers work on a single branch, often referred to as 'trunk' or 'main'. The main aim of this approach is to avoid the complexities that arise from managing multiple long-lived branches. Instead, developers commit their changes directly to the trunk, keeping it always in a releasable state.

The integration of feature flags, such as the TBD_FF feature flag, plays a crucial role in enabling trunk-based development. They allow developers to hide in-progress features from users, enabling testing and refinement without disrupting the user experience.

## Key Benefits of Trunk-based Development

Trunk-based development offers numerous advantages that enhance software development processes:

### Accelerates Delivery
By committing directly to the trunk, developers can integrate their changes quickly, leading to faster delivery of features. This directly aligns with the principles of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).

### Improves Code Quality
With trunk-based development, code review becomes a continuous process. This ensures that any issues are identified and corrected promptly, enhancing the overall quality of the code.

### Enhances Collaboration
Trunk-based development promotes a collaborative environment where all changes are visible to the entire team. This transparency fosters better communication and teamwork.

## Enabling Trunk-based Development

In practice, trunk-based development can be enabled by turning on the TBD_FF feature flag. This allows developers to wrap their in-progress features in Unleash flags, effectively hiding them until they're ready for user testing or deployment.

In addition, the use of tools such as Jira, Bitbucket, and Confluence can further streamline the process. These tools facilitate project management, version control, and documentation, respectively, making them invaluable for teams practicing trunk-based development.

## Real-world Use Case

Consider a mid-sized SaaS company building a customer-facing analytics dashboard using trunk-based development. Developers commit directly to the main, wrapping in-progress features in Unleash flags for safe deployments. 

For instance, while building a new “Real-Time Insights” panel, backend and frontend changes were integrated incrementally over several weeks, with the UI gated behind a realtime_insights_enabled flag. This approach allowed internal QA and selected beta users to test the feature early without impacting the broader user base. 

As feedback came in, the team iterated quickly, toggling the feature on for more users before eventually removing the flag and making the feature available to everyone. This approach facilitated continuous integration, faster feedback loops, and safer experimentation—all without the complexity of long-lived branches.
