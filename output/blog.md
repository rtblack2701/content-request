# Introduction
Welcome to the world of trunk-based development, a much-debated topic among software developers and DevOps practitioners. As the software industry continues to evolve towards more agile and lean methodologies, trunk-based development has emerged as a key practice in enabling faster, high-quality software releases. 

# What is Trunk-based Development?
Trunk-based development is a software development practice where all developers work on a single branch, often called ‘trunk’ or 'main'. Instead of creating separate branches for feature development, all changes are integrated directly into the trunk. This approach minimizes the complexity and risks associated with long-lived branches and large merge conflicts. 

# Key Benefits of Trunk-based Development
Trunk-based development can significantly **accelerate delivery** by enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It eliminates the waiting periods for feature branches to be merged into the mainline, allowing for faster iterations and releases.

The practice also helps to **improve code quality**. With all developers committing changes to the trunk, there's a constant cycle of code review and feedback, which helps to catch and fix issues quickly.

Moreover, trunk-based development can **enhance collaboration** among team members. It encourages communication and coordination as developers work together on the same codebase, fostering a collective code ownership culture.

# Real-world Use Case
Consider a mid-sized SaaS company building a customer-facing analytics dashboard. They adopted trunk-based development in combination with feature management to accelerate delivery while minimizing risk. Developers committed directly to main, wrapping in-progress features in Unleash flags to ensure safe deployments.

For instance, while working on a new “Real-Time Insights” panel, backend and frontend changes were integrated incrementally over several weeks, with the UI gated behind a `realtime_insights_enabled` flag. This allowed internal QA and selected beta users to test the feature early without impacting the broader user base. As feedback poured in, the team iterated quickly, toggling the feature on for more users before eventually removing the flag and making the feature available to everyone. 

This approach enabled continuous integration, faster feedback loops, and safer experimentation—all without the complexity of long-lived branches.

# How Unleash Supports This
Unleash offers a robust feature management platform that complements trunk-based development. It allows teams to wrap new features in feature flags, enabling them to safely test and gradually roll out changes in the mainline code. This ensures that new features can be developed and integrated without disrupting the user experience, significantly reducing the risks associated with continuous delivery.
